A : Hello, NAME? This is NAME in 4C. 0
B : Hi, NAME. What can I do for you? 0
A : My garbage disposal went south. -1
B : Does it turn at all? 0
A : There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch. -1
B : Did it die suddenly? 0
A : It started to make a weird sound last week. -1
B : You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you? -1
A : No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe once a week. 0
B : Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently. -1
A : Once a week might not be enough, huh? -1
B : There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up. 0
A : Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it. -1
B : How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it? 0
A : Come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys. 0
B : The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman. -1
A : It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not. 1
B : Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we? -1
