A : She's really pretty, isn't she? Her skin looks so baby smooth! 1
B : Well, it's just that she puts lots of make-up on her face. Actually, natural beauty comes from within. -1
A : Ah, I can smell jealousy in the air! -1

A : Yeah, right! But what did you put on your face last night, those little greenish things? -1
B : They're cucumbers. They're natural skin soothers, natural healers of the skin. Haven't you heard them say on TV that, erh, they soften the skin, wipe out the roughness, counter irritation, and build strength and resilience? 1

B : That's right! You've learned a lot, haven't you? 1
