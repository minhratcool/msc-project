B : The rest? 0
A : Yeah! B, if my breasts were saggy, would you still love me? 0
B : What? 0
A : Answer my question, please! -1
B : What a silly question! Love has nothing to do with breasts being large or small, or being firm or saggy. -1

Age has set in! Maybe I also need a lift. Maybe, I need a new life! Oh, I really miss the good old days. At that time, my skin really felt so baby smooth! -1
B : A. what're you murmuring about? It's getting late. You should've been in bed minutes ago. 0
