B : Do you know that it's mostly caused by television? 0
A : But sometimes children who don't like watching TV are also naughty. -1

A : What is the best done by parent to stop violence on TV? -1
B : I think it's rather hard to stop violence on TV, because children today have much more freedom and chance to watch TV anywhere and anytime as well. Moreover, the media itself often more concerns about profit rather than quality. . -1
A : So ? 0
B : Parent must have good communication to children and give understanding about the harm of watching violence, and children need to be controlled in watching TV. 0
A : I agree with you. But how can we at least eliminate bad TV program, because I believe that parent can't control children 24 hours, right? -1
B : Start from ourselves, don't watch uneducated programs, if possible, tell friends or relatives not to watch them either. By doing so, hopefully the rating of the programs will be low, and in turn, TV will not broadcast low rate programs. -1
