A : Hi NAME. What are you looking for? 0
B : Oh hi NAME. I'm looking for some materials to make a solar system. 0
A : A solar system? 0
B : Yeah, NAME has a science project. He has to make a model of the solar system with the sun and the planets. 0
A : How about some balls? They can represent the planets and the sun. 0
B : I was looking for some foam balls, but I can't find any in our garage. 0
A : I might have some. NAME had to make a solar system model a few years ago. I might have some balls left over. 0
B : That would be great! NAME wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board. 1
A : That's what NAME did too. 0
B : Was NAME in Mrs. NAME's science class? 0
A : Yes! 1
B : She must have the students do the same project every year. 0
A : It's a great project. We had a fun time doing it together. 1
B : Are there eight or nine planets now? When I was a child, Pluto was a planet. But it's not considered a major planet anymore. 0
A : I know. I think scientists are still debating that issue. NAME should ask his teacher. 0
B : Good idea. 1
A : Let me go look for the balls. I think I still have her model in the garage too. I'll be right back. 1
B : Thank you! I'll keep looking in my garage too. 1
