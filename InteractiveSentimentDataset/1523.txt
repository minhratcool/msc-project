A : What are you doing today? 0
B : Hi NAME. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him. 0
A : That's a great idea. 1
B : Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely. 1
A : We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it? 0
B : Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games. 0
A : Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money. 1
B : I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too. 1
A : Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves. 0
B : I'm hoping NAME saves and saves. 0
A : Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother. -1
B : Wow! Does your younger son loan him money? 0
A : Yeah, but he adds on interest. 0
B : That's funny and smart. He's like a bank. 1
A : He wants to be a banker one day. 0
B : This is giving him great experience. 1
A : Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother. 0
