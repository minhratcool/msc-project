A : NAME, I'm very upset about something. Can I talk with you? I'd like your opinion. -1
B : What is it about? Oh, is it about NAME? 0
A : Yeah, sort of.... -1
B : So, what's up? 0
A : What do you think of NAME, NAME? 0
B : What do I think of him? You know him better than I do, don't you? 0
A : Please, don't tease me. Just tell me. -1
B : Well, remember the other day when you said that NAME is a man who really shows you nothing but consideration? 0
A : Uh-hunh... 0
B : And remember you said that he really makes you happy? 0
A : Yeah. (Heave a sigh) NAME is indeed a gentleman. He has wonderful manners and is respectful of me. But I'm really bothered by his past! -1
B : His past!? Was he an ex-con or something? 0
A : No, no, no. That's not what I mean. He used to have a girlfriend and he loved her very much. He almost married her if it were not for an accident. -1
B : Oh, I see. But why are you so bothered? That's already a history, isn't it? 0
A : I know. But I just can't get it off my mind. -1
B : Come on, NAME. You're just being a little jealous, but that's just fine. You know, when you love him, you've got to love his past, his everything.... You've got to love him as a whole. 1
